Implementing this constraint in Rails is easy with validations; to accept microposts with at most 140 characters (Ã  la Twitter), we use a length validation. At this point, you should open the file app/models/micropost.rb in your text editor or IDE and fill it with the contents of Listing 2.9. (The use of validates in Listing 2.9 is characteristic of Rails 3; if youâ€™ve previously worked with Rails 2.3, you should compare this to the use of validates_length_of.)", "user_id"=>"1"}, "commit"=>"Create Micropost"}
